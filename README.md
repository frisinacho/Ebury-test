# Ebury-test
This repo contains the "Ebury-test" source code.

The project doesn't have all the milestones that are specified in the requirements and the _wireframe_. 
Everything I've achieved is in the **master** branch.
(The rest branches are unfinished features)

To run the project you could use the `autoscript.sh`
